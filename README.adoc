# Data/UI modeling in Fulcro: Project Tasks App

Let's try to create this app:

## Analysis questions

1. What is the shape of the UI? => LeftPane with SprintsListItem etc., MiddlePane with SprintsListDetails, ...
2. What are the data entities and graph? => Sprints (with both detail and list item attributes), ...
3. How do they map to each other and how to express it with Fulcro idents, queries, and extra graph edges? +
   => You might need to add extra _edges_ and structure on top of the data entities to make them fit your UI.
4. What server-side resolvers do we have / need? Related to how we want to load the data - all at once, piecemeal, or on-demand (w.r.t. the details).
+
TIP: It might be easier not to worry about data loading at first, just assume the data entities the UI needs have been loaded somehow.

## Possible defsc structuring

1. All are siblings (b/c that is the UI we want)
+
--
   * Root
   ** Menu
   ** MenuItemDetails (= Today|TaskList)
   ** Calendar
--
+
.. Variant: Root queries directly for individual lists and we use Pathom placeholders to add the extra UI structure for the list item vs details components:
   `[{:>/sprints-item (get-query SprintsItem)} {:>/sprints-details (get-query SprintsDetails)} ...]` = `[:sprints-list/label, {:sprints-list/sprints [..]}  ...]`
.. Variant: TODO: ...
2. Shared parent for selector + detail (similar to 1. but with extra structure to group the two summary-details views):
   * Root
   ** TaskLists
   *** Menu
   *** MenuItemDetails
   ** Calendar
3. Other options: Use union queries / dynamic queries so we only query for the details we need...
